## Project Description
The *Furniture Dataset Prediction* project aims to analyze the provided dataset and build predictive models for key metrics such as sales, demand forecasting, or customer segmentation. The project leverages data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains relevant information such as:
- Product IDs
- Categories
- Sales volume
- Inventory levels
- Customer demographics
- Pricing information

You can explore the dataset [here](link-to-dataset).

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/furniture-dataset-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd furniture-dataset-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Once the environment is set up, you can run the project as follows:

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   Use the data preprocessing scripts to clean and prepare the dataset.
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Model Training:**
   Train the machine learning models using the provided script.
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. **Predictions:**
   Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/new_furniture_data.csv
   ```

## Models and Techniques
The following models and techniques are used in the project:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, feature scaling, and encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations to understand key trends and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R-Squared Score

## Results
The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and generalization to unseen data. The best-performing model achieved an R² score of X and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of Y on the test set.
